# cmot4r: Computational MOdel Toolbox for R

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
cmot4r is an R package that provides functions for data preprocessing and computational modeling using data with CBAT. cmot4r package includes the following R packages:
- cba-toolbox/PRLpreprocess : Preprocessing of Probabilistic Reversal Learning Data

## Installation

You can install the development version of cmot4r from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cba-toolbox/cmot4r")
```

## Example

cmot4rintegrates several R packages from different GitHub repositories, so installing cmot4r results in the installation of multiple GitHub-based R packages. Below, I demonstrate how to use the PRLpreprocess package, which handles preprocessing for probabilistic reversal learning tasks, to read and preprocess CSV file data.

``` r
data <- PRLpreprocess::PRL_preprocess_csv("data.csv")
plot(data$choice)
plot(data$reward)
```
